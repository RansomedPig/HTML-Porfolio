    <h3><a href="public/Graduation Invite.html">Graduation Invitation Project</a></h3>
        <p>This project was supposed to be a birthday invitation, but my sister in law was graduating
                with a masters in dietetics, so I couldn't help making a basic invitation to send off to the family
                so that we could all meet up and celebrate.

    <h3><a href="public/Movie Ranking.html">Movie Rankings</a></h3>
        <p>This project was fairly straightforward. I don't have many movies that I watch regularly, but I have
                seen Jurassic park well over 100 times.
