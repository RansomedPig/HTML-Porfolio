<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm 32 years old and based in Vineyard, Utah. I've been here for roughly 7 years, and I've been steadiliy dipping my toes into IT.
  My journey into IT started with basic helpdesk, and eventually evolved into working with a softphone called Five9 for Vivint Smarthome.
  I worked with Vivint for about 3 years, and moved onto my next opportunity with Foundation Finance LLC, where I continued working with Five9,
  but also began working to learn new skills to improve my capabilities. Each day we're given 2 hours of professional development, and so I've been working
  hard to build up my capacity for front end web development, starting with HTML.
  </p>

<p>In my spare time, I'm also constantly trying to learn new hobbies and skills. I currently 3d print and paint miniatures, leatherwork, make dreamcatchers,
  and am learning woodburning. My wife and I spend a lot of time hobbying together, and when we're not crafting we're out cycling together or finding nature walks to go on.
  We were married in March 2024, and we have a dog together with the hopes of eventually expanding our family further.
</p>

<p>That's about it for now, please take a look at the work I've completed so far, I am open to any and all feedback.

Thank you!
